The goal for this class is to learn the input files for the NF_CORE ChIPseq pipeline.

*********************
Input files
*********************

The NF_CORE ChIPseq pipeline requires a few input files.

1) Config file:  tells next flow how to talk to Fiji
2) shell script: info on what resources can be used on Fiji & where input files are for pipeline
3) design file: This has all the info needed for ChIP data (replicates, input controls etc)

*********************
1. Config File
*********************

The Config file tells nextflow how to run on fiji by giving some instructions.

First let's navigate to where we are going to run the NF_CORE pipeline

```{bash nextflow.config file}

# first make a new analysis directory for 06 then navigate to it:

cd scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/'your_folder'/class_exeRcises/analysis/06_CHIPSEQ

# making the .config file
nano nextflow.config

# Paste in the following code into the nextflow.config file

process {
  executor='slurm'
  queue='short'
  memory='32 GB'
  maxForks=10
}

```
Cool now we can have nextflow talk to Fiji in SLURM

The contents of the file are:

executor : what language does Fiji speak (Next flow speaks many languages like C3PO)
SLURM is a simple job scheduler.

queue : there is a long and short queue (<24h)

memory : This sets RAM or memory SLURM can use to communicate
with next flow (usual doesn't need much)

maxforks : this tells nextflow how many processes can be run in parallel.


*****************************
2. Design file 
*****************************

The design file will tell NF_CORE ChIPseq pipeline which samples are which.

The design file will change depending on which NF_CORE Pipeline you are running

Let's make a design file for chip-seq:

```{bash design file}

nano design.csv

# paste in the following required information for NF_CORE ChIPseq pipeline
# NF_core documentation will guide you to new changes in design file.

group,replicate,fastq_1,fastq_2,antibody,control

```


*********************
3. Shell script 
*********************

The shell script is going to contain two parts:

a) SLURM instructions on how to run the pipeline (memory etc)
b) The specifics for NF_CORE ChIPseq pipeline

Let's make a run.sh file

```{bash}

nano run.sh

# Paste the code below into the run.sh (note the #s are part of slurm speak)
# Note that the pound sign is required.

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p short
#SBATCH --job-name=Hepg2_Pol_test
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=john.rinn@colorado.edu
#SBATCH --output=nextflow.out
#SBATCH --error=nextflow.err
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --mem=6gb
#SBATCH --time=10:00:00

pwd; hostname; date
echo "Lets do chipseq"

module load singularity/3.1.1

nextflow run nf-core/chipseq -r 1.2.1 \
-profile singularity \
--single_end \
--input design.csv \
--fasta /Shares/rinn_class/data/genomes/human/gencode/v32/GRCh38.p13.genome.fa \
--gtf /Shares/rinn_class/data/genomes/human/gencode/v32/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf \
--macs_gsize 3.2e9 \
--blacklist /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/data/hg38-blacklist.v2.bed \
--email john.rinn@colorado.edu \
-resume \
-c nextflow.config

date

```

Here is what is going on line by line:

First step is the basic SLURM set up

```{bash slurm instructions}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p short
#SBATCH --job-name=Hepg2_Pol_test
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=identikey@colorado.edu


### These lines are telling the slurm scheduler what resources we need. Here we're saying we
### want to be in the short queue (For jobs that take less than 24 hrs to run. Name of the job, who to email etc...

```

Now we are goint to set up the resources to be used on FIJI (be careful in practice

```{bash slurm instructions}
#SBATCH --nodes=1
### Fiji has multiple nodes and you will rarely want to run a job across more 
### than one node. 

#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#### This is how many cpus you're requesting. We wil typically
#### leave this at 1 so the nextflow runs only on one cpu (single-threaded). 
#### For some software, they can by run multicore and you may want more that one cpu.


#SBATCH --mem=6gb

#### Simply setting how much RAM memory you're requesting for your job. This is an important consideration
#### depending on how much RAM your software uses to do the compute task.
  

#SBATCH --time=10:00:00

## The other noteable is the "WALL CLOCK" 
## THIS IS WHERE GOOD MANNERS come into play. You want to test this out on a few
## files and then think about how it will scale. This run.sh file is for thousadnds
## of FASTQ files, we will change the wall clock.

```

It is super useful when running so many tasks to have
an output file that updates at each step.
Also an error file that if something goes wrong explains exactly
the line of code that broke.

```{bash out and err files}

#SBATCH --output=nextflow.out
#SBATCH --error=nextflow.err

```


# NEXTFLOW Parameters 
Second is the nextflow instructions for the NF_CORE pipeline
Each line is a command ended by \ 
(make sure there are no extra spaces after \ -- a common bug)

```{BASH nextflow parameters}

pwd; hostname; date
echo "Here we go again $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE core."

# The first step is telling the pathway, hostname and date of where and when job was run.
# the echo command is sort of silly and just let's you know the SLURM set up was successful!


module load singularity/3.1.1

# module load singularity/3.1.1 is going to load singularity & tell bash to use singularity.

# What is Singularity: this creates a empty compute environment where packages can be installed,
# run and version tracked. Thus, we are making a "container" of the nextflow pipeline
# that is version tracked and is 100% reproducible.

nextflow run nf-core/chipseq -r 1.1.0 \

# We actually did this in the 05.RMD, basically nextflow loads the NF_CORE pipeline fresh each time.

-profile singularity \

# This is telling nextflow (with the single -) to talk in singularity (others could be docker etc)

--single_end \

# Now we are setting NF_CORE ChIPseq specific parameters (with --) in this case the data is single-end reads

--input design.csv \

# Giving NF_CORE specific design file. 
--fasta /Shares/rinn_class/data/genomes/human/gencode/v32/GRCh38.p13.genome.fa \

# The genome file that will be used to align reads to -- you can change to any species.

--gtf /Shares/rinn_class/data/genomes/human/gencode/v32/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf \

# genome feature file provided by GENCODE. Tells where genes, promoters etc are in .GTF format.
# https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/

--macs_gsize 2.7e9 \

# MACS3 will be run to call peaks and for some reason needs to know the genome size :)

--blacklist hg38-blacklist.v2.bed \

# Some regions of the genome are very difficult to align short-reads to so they are flagged out

--email john.rinn@colorado.edu \

# You will get an email with a funny job name (random-adjective_scientist-name)
# You get an email telling you if it succeeded (exit status 0) or failed (exit status 1)

-resume \

# This is amazing NEXTFLOW parameter (noted by single -) that will start right where you left off!

-c nextflow.config

# Final nextflow command (single -) to load the config file to talk to slurm

date

# This is a bash command that simply prints the date
```

Here is a full "run.sh" script with slurm instructions and nextflow.

```{SLURM and NEXTFLOW run.sh}

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p short
#SBATCH --job-name=CTCF_test
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=teva8543@colorado.edu
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --mem=6gb
#SBATCH --time=10:00:00
#SBATCH --output=nextflow.out
#SBATCH --error=nextflow.err
pwd; hostname; date
echo "Lets go"
module load singularity/3.1.1
nextflow run nf-core/chipseq -r 1.2.1 \
-profile singularity \
--paired_end \
--input design.csv \
--fasta /scratch/Shares/rinn/genomes/Homo_sapiens/Gencode/v38/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa \
--gtf /scratch/Shares/rinn/genomes/Homo_sapiens/Gencode/v38/gencode.v38.annotation.gtf \
--macs_gsize 3.2e9 \
--blacklist /scratch/Shares/rinn/genomes/Homo_sapiens/Gencode/v38/hg38-blacklist.v2.bed \
--email teva8543@colorado.edu \
-resume \
-c nextflow.config
date


```

Here is the full config file
```{BASH}

process {
  executor='slurm'
  queue='short'
  memory='32 GB'
  maxForks=10
}

```

Now all you need is a design file with correct headers.

group,replicate,fastq_1,fastq_2,antibody,control

### RUN TIME

With these three files in the directory you want to run your analysis
all you need to do is :

```{SLURM running shell script}

sbatch run.sh

# Then to track progress :

tail -f nextflow.out

```
