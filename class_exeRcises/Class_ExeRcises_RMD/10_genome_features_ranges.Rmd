### Have you ever wanted to find overlaps between two lists of genes? Well
Iranges and GRanges are just the thing!

#### Iranges allows one to index "windows" with properties. Say you had a vector
of all genes and wanted to track start and stop. Iranges can keep the start, 
stop and width of values. So this list of ranges (start and stop) for each 
gene-length is essentially a vector or each column a gene id. With this indexing
we can now apply several attributes to these ranges. For example if an enhancer 
or other feature resided in the gene we could also track the start, stop of that
"interval". 

#### Granges is even more specially aadapted for features in a given genome. All
the start, stops for each feature is given similar to Iranges. However, we could
have a big problem since we have 23 chromosomes in the geneome! So simple start
and stop indexing isn't enough as there could be up to 23 redudant "intervals" 
that are actually unique. So we need to consider choromosome and coordinates. 
Worse we also should think about the strand. So GRanges works similar to Iranges
just having the advantage of indexing chromosome and strand to the start and stop.


#### Let's go explore the human geneome annotations from GENCODE.
We will do this by importing a GTF file of these annotaitons.
A GTF file is similar in a way to a .bed file with start stop of features
and other associated metadata that is described here:

https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html


## Ok enough background let's start exploring the features of the human genome!
```{r loading in GENCODE GRanges annotation file}

# we used rtracklayer::import to turn the annotations into start and stops (Iranges) w/ chr (Granges)
# This takes ~5min

gencode_gr <- rtracklayer::import("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/data/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf")

# let's take a look @metadata to see what we have in here

```

Now let's look at the gene_id indexable part of this GRanges
# seqnames
```{r seqnames}

?seqnames
  
seqnames(gencode_gr) %>% 
  head()


# we can see that "levels" are the chromosome names and are a meta-level
```

let's get more info with table to summary using tidy verse %>%
# summary / table a GRanges object
```{R summary/table GRanges}

table(seqnames(gencode_gr)) %>%
  head()
# This is telling us how many features are associated with each chromosome.

table(seqnames(gencode_gr)) %>% 
  summary()
# this tells us how many features there are in the genome.

# Let's find out how many features the mitochondrial chr has (25th level)
table(seqnames(gencode_gr))[25] 

# we see this is the mitochondrial chromosome and has 143 elements

```

# Indexing Granges (@elementMetadata$INDEXING)
```{R indexing GRanges}

# we see a lot of good infromation in @elementMetadata -- let's index it.

# let's see how many 'gene_id' values there are by indexing
table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_id) %>% 
  head()
# This tell us how many features are associated with each gene id.

# Let's see what we get with gene_name
table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_name) %>% 
  head()

# Typical gene symbols 
table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$transcript_name) %>%
  head()

# it's basically memorization of what is a gene name or gene id 

```


Let's analyze some of the features of our genome!
# Making a data frame of items in GRanges object
```{r GRanges indexing to data.frame}

#let's organize the data frame first and put it into a data frame.

gencode_gr_length <- data.frame("gene_id" = gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_id,
                           "gene_name" = gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_name,
                           "gene_type" = gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_type,
                           "type" = gencode_gr@elementMetadata$type,
                           "start" = gencode_gr@ranges@start,
                           "width" = gencode_gr@ranges@width)

#TODO add chrm and search for genes per chr
                           
```
Ok so now we have a new data frame with the information we want from gencode_gr
Note we see that we can index the RANGES for each gene with @ranges "level"

Let's look at the width for mRNA genes
# mRNA gene width
```{R mRNA gene width}

mrna_df <- filter(gencode_gr_length, gene_type == "protein_coding", type == "gene")

# table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$gene_type)

# we can easily plot a histogram of mRNA gene widths.
hist(log10(mrna_df$width), breaks = 60)

# same for lncRNAs
lncrna_df <- filter(gencode_gr_length, gene_type == "lncRNA", type == "gene")

# plotting lncRNA
hist(log10(lncrna_df$width), breaks = 60)

# Let's see what the average gene size is. Note we can no longer use width in a DF

mean(lncrna_df$width)
mean(mrna_df$width)

# this all points to mRNAs being 2x longer than lncRNAs.
```

Now let's go find the widths associated with gene-length. 
# How many types of "gene types" are there?
```{R gene types}

# indexing into gene typse 
table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$type)

## cool this tell us a lot about the genome with one line!

```

# Finding genome feature lengths
let's find the longest and shortest genes in the genome!
But first let's see how to find the lengths of genome features.
```{R annotation lengths} 

# Let's see the range of gene sizes
summary(width(gencode_gr))

# interesting some genes are just 1 nt long!
# let's look into that some more

# we will use indexing and setting a value
width_1_items <- gencode_gr[width(gencode_gr) == 1] %>%
  as.data.frame()

# let's look
table(width_1_items$type)
# so weird that a CDS can be 1nt or an exon.

# looking for weird exons
weird_exons <- width_1_items %>% 
  filter(type == "exon")
# huh 33 exons are 1 nt -- annotations are never perfect :)


# The one thing that should be 1nt long is a TSS
# to get the TSS we need to use the promters function:
tss <- promoters(gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"], 
                 upstream = 0, downstream = 0) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# we see 60,609 TSS. Let's see if that is the same as # of genes
summary(gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"])
# cool the same

# This code will search for any feature and see if any are 1nt
#TODO refactor to CDS
start_codons <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "CDS"] 

summary(width(start_codons))

# More weird 1nt features
length(which(width(start_codons) == 1))

# 567 start codons 1nt long -- that can't be right :)

?which

```

# Longest and shortest genes
```{longest and shortest gene in human genome}

# Let's turn gencode_gr into a data.frame and filter to only genes.
gencode_df <- gencode_gr %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  filter(type == "gene")

# Let's find the smallest genes using arrange function
gencode_df %>% 
  arrange(gencode_df$width) %>%
  head()

# Now let's find the Largest genes using arrange
gencode_df %>%
  arrange(-width) %>%
  head()

# We can also store the longest gene as an object with max function
longest_gene <- gencode_df %>%
  filter(width == max(width))

# let's take a look at what information we have for this gene:
longest_gene

```

Now let's find the total amount of the genome covered by exons.
We start by defining total_exon_length of all exons in genome.

# we need to use reduce to collapse all the exons that overlap into the longest exon
# Exon 1.1  _____________
# Exon 1.2      _____________
# reduce    _________________
# intersect     _________


Ok let's find out what % of genome is exons!
```{R % of genome that is exons}

# first we will make an object of exons and reduce them as described above
total_exon_length <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "exon"] %>%
  GenomicRanges::reduce() %>% 
  width() %>%
  sum()

table(total_exon_length)
# We now have the total bases covered by exons in the human genome. We also know
# the human genome is 3.9B base pairs so let's find the percentage by division:

total_exon_length/3.2e9
# Boom we can see the human genome is about 4% exons!

# We can do the same for gene bodies too
reduced_gene_bodies <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"] %>%
  GenomicRanges::reduce() %>%
  width() %>%
  sum()

reduced_gene_bodies/3.2e9

# plotting
hist(width(reduced_gene_bodies), breaks = 100)

```

# genome features overlapping chip data
Now let's use GRanges to find overlaps of genome features and peaks from ChIPseq.
This is probably one of the most commonly used functions in genome sciences!
First we need to import POLR2A Chip-seq files -- a simple .bed file of peaks.

```{r start point : import Pol2 chip data}

# Load Gencode-v32: 
gencode_gr <- rtracklayer::import("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/data/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf")

# Import Pol2 "consensus peaks" file
pol2_chip <- rtracklayer::import("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/data/POLR2A_consensus_peaks_filter.bed")

```

# promoters function
Now let's define the promoters using the handy promoters function in GRanges

```{R promoters}

?promoters

# let's add 3Kb upstream and downstream from the TSS to define "promoters"
gencode_promoters <- promoters(gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"], 
                               upstream = 3e3, 
                               downstream = 3e3)


length(gencode_promoters)
# there are ~60,000 promoters 

```

# findOVerlaps function
Now we have promoter ranges and peak ranges let's use findOverlaps function

```{R findoverlaps chip peaks &}

# Promoter overlap function requires two parameters:
# Query file (peaks) and subject file (promoters)
promoter_overlaps <- findOverlaps(pol2_chip, gencode_promoters)
promoter_overlaps
# We get back a list of ranges of the overlaps 
# This is a single Grange that has "indexable" @from & @to
# Note @from (subject) @to (query)


# What is the length of the Grange (overlaps)?
length(promoter_overlaps)
# We can find how many overlaps there were by the length function:
# "length" of the resulting overlap list
# looks like 13,771 overlaps!
```

```{R @from and @to of G(ranges)}

length(promoter_overlaps@from)
# This tell us there are 13,771 overlaps of chip-peaks (from promoters)
# This doesn't tell us how many promoters had overlaps

length(promoter_overlaps@to)
# This tell us there are 13,771 overlaps with promoters (to chip-peaks)
# Look in env variable and we see both are the same


# Let's dig deeper into @from and @to with table
table(table(promoter_overlaps@from))
# We see ONE chip-peak overlapped 16 promoters (the sum of these numbers is 13,771)

# Now for @ to
table(table(promoter_overlaps@to))
# We see 12,831 promoters had an overlap with one peak and
# 4 promoters had an overlap with 3 peaks.
# *** the sum is 13,299 ***

```

# Sometimes it's easier to view these things in data frames
```{R data frame view of @from & @to}

# Turning single Grange to data frame 
promoter_overlaps_df <- data.frame(pol2_index = promoter_overlaps@from,
                                   promoter_index = promoter_overlaps@to)

promoter_overlaps_df
# 13,771 enteries
# look at env


# let's make a data-frame of what we just did above separate for @from & @to

# @from data frame (look in env)
at_from_table <- table(promoter_overlaps@from) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

#@to data frame (look in env)
at_to_table <- table(promoter_overlaps@to) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

# digging deeper into @to adn @from
Let's dig into what information results from findOverlaps

```{R 10K peaks have 13K overlaps}

# let's determine the length of our pol2_chip Grange (number of peaks)
length(pol2_chip)
# 10,255 peaks 


# Number of peaks that overlap promoters
length(table(promoter_overlaps@from))


table(table(promoter_overlaps@to))
#  1     2     3 
# 12831   464     4 

# Thus, 13,771 = 12,831 + 2*464(=928) + 3*4(=12) -> 13,771
# or 12,831 + 928 + 12 = 13,771

### How many of these are unique:
# 12,831 + 464 + 4 = 13,299
# We will come back to this

```

# Different dataframe persepective on overlaps
```{R accounting oerlaps in @to and @from}

# Let's look at all the peak overlaps (13,771) in two different data frames:
# Data frame from peak perspective (@from)
overlapping_pol2 <- pol2_chip[promoter_overlaps_df$pol2_index] %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# Data frame from promoter perspective (@to)
overlapping_promoters <- gencode_promoters[promoter_overlaps_df$promoter_index] %>% 
  as.data.frame()
# note most promoters are unique
# >> Note both are 13,771 long

# Now let's merge these two data frames (they both have the same gene_id)
# We are using the promoter_overlaps_df we made above as it's the same as
# overlapping_pol2

promoter_overlaps_df$promoter_gene_id <- overlapping_promoters$gene_id
promoter_overlaps_df
# Look in env

# adding more data to the same data frame (gene_name & peak_name)
# adding gene_name
promoter_overlaps_df$promoter_gene_name <- overlapping_promoters$gene_name

# adding pol2 chip-peak name
promoter_overlaps_df$peak_name <- overlapping_pol2$name

# How many promoters had overlaps:
length(unique(promoter_overlaps_df$promoter_gene_id))
# Chip-peaks overlapped 13,299 promoters.

# Now lets find the length of "unique" pol2 chip-peaks
length(unique(promoter_overlaps_df$peak_name))
# We can see 7,738 peaks were in the overlaps
# Thus ~2K were not overlapping promoters (10K chip peaks total)

# IN CONCLUSION:

# 7,738 of 10,255 Pol2 ChiP-peaks observed overlapped 13,299 promoters.

# Thus, it is important to know how overlaps work to be sure you have the
# correct numbers !

```

Let's bring this all back together.

10,255 chip-peaks were observed
7,738 of these peaks overlapped  13,771 promoter overlaps (@from)
13,771 promoters had overlaps (@to)
13,299 unique promoters had overlaps (@to)


So 7,738 overlapping peaks resulted in 13,771 overlaps with promoters which represented 13,299 unique promoters.

EXCERCISE
*********************


What happens if we shrink the promoter windows? Some standards are 2Kb upstream 1kb down stream. 
Some could be as small as 1Kb upstream 500Kb downstream. Try two different promter window sizes and record
@from and @to values as well as unique peaks.
