Today we will install nextflow and install the nf-core/chip-seq pipeline. Briefly, Nextflow
is a taks manager that will send thousands of tasks (some in parallel) to fiji. NF_CORE has
developed pipelines for ChIPseq, RNAseq, ATACseq and pretty much anything with seq. We need 
to install Nextflow on fiji so they can communicate. Ultimately we will use nextflow to task
manage the NF_CORE pipeline that will run ChiP seq from genome alignment to calling peaks to
providing all the QC needed for publication. 

Nextflow has amazing documentation and a good place to start is here:
https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html


Let's install Nextflow into our bin directory
 

****************
Step 1 Install:
****************

Nextflow will install itself with this simple commmand below. However, you will
want to think about where to install it. 

A reasonable place to install it is in a "bin" directory within your home directory

/Users/<identikey>/bin/nextflow

Alrighty, give it a go:

```{bash}
cd ~
ls -lah
cd bin

# if you don't see a bin directory make one using the commands below. 

mkdir bin
cd bin

# Then install nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Nice it's installed just like that! curl went and got a bash script (silent -s)
and the results of that query were piped to bash which runs the script to install itself.

This is nifty, but the fact that you can run a script from the internet highlights that you
should be careful that you trust the website, etc.

If you ever want to update nextflow just run the above. At the time of this doc
it is at: v20.10.0

********************************
Step 2: Add nextflow to $PATH
********************************

The $PATH is a default place the computer will look for commands. Imagine you
had to tell Bash where the ls command is?

/usr/bin/ls to list files instead of just ls

So that path is an important aspect of unix/bash that you will never really hear
about until it becomes a bug :) 

Let's put nextflow in our path (just as ls, cd etc are) so we can call it from anywhere on fiji.

```{bash}

echo $PATH
# we can make it easier to read with TRANSFORM (tr) a powerful bash command to
# repalce and find text.

echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"
# kinda hard to read with : seperated file
```


Now let's add it to our .profile file which will load each time you login to the terminal
```{R}
cd ~/.profile
```

To append a directory to PATH, we just need to overwrite the path variable
To assign a variable in bash the assignment operator is the equals sign. 
When referring to the contents saved in an environment variable, the $ is used
```{bash}

PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

This will change the PATH environment variable during this session only,
but now we want this in the profile that is loaded at each login 

```{bash}
nano .profile
PATH=$PATH:~/bin
source ~/.profile
```


Now check that nextflow can be run without referring to it's location
```{BASH}

nextflow -version
```

Sweet, that's it. We've successfully installed nextflow, added to $APTH and can use from anywhere now!


****************
Step 3: Install nf-core/chipseq pipeline
****************

Now we want to install the chipseq pipeline from NF-core. The cool thing about 
this set up is essentially you are going to clone the latest github for chipseq
by default. Simply run:


```
nextflow pull nf-core/chipseq
```

If you want a specific version you can use the flag to call that version.
At the time of this document chipseq is at 1.2.1. 

```
nextflow pull -r 1.2.1 nf-core/chipseq
```

Whenever the pipeline is run, it actually does this step behind the scenes,
so you don't actually need to do this in order to have the chipseq pipeline install.
This means that if you want to run an older version, you can just indicate that when
you're running that pipeline and it will install that version if it's not 
already installed.

*********************
Step 4: Think about your directory structure
*********************

We have set up the class with the following directory structure -- let's make your directory nice and tidy.
We will run our first test ChIP in the work directory.

```{BASH}
cd /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/your_folder.
mkdir results
mkdir work
mkdir analysis

cd work
```
