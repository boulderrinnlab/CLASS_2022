Today we will install nextflow and install the nf-core/chip-seq pipeline. 

Briefly, Nextflow is a taks manager that will send and organize thousands of tasks.

NF_CORE has developed pipelines for ChIPseq, RNAseq, ATACseq and pretty much anything with seq. 

Firstt: We need to install Nextflow on fiji so they can communicate. 

Ultimately we will use nextflow to task manage the NF_CORE pipeline(s)
There are so many tasks in the pipelines that it has all the QC needed for publicaton.


Nextflow has amazing documentation and a good place to start is here:
https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html


Let's install Nextflow into our bin directory
 

****************
Step 1 Install:
****************

Nextflow will install itself with this simple commmand below. However, you will
want to think about where to install it. 

A reasonable place to install it is in a "bin" directory within your home directory

/Users/<identikey>/bin/nextflow

Alrighty, give it a go:

```{bash install nextflow}

cd ~
ls -lah
cd bin

# if you don't see a bin directory make one using the commands below. 

mkdir bin
cd bin

# Then install nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Nice it's installed just like that! 
curl went and got a bash script (silent -s)
and the results of that query were piped to bash 
which runs the script to install itself.


If you ever want to update nextflow just run the above. At the time of this doc
it is at: v20.10.0

********************************
Step 2: Add nextflow to $PATH 
********************************

The $PATH is a default place the computer will look for commands. Imagine you
had to tell Bash where the ls command is?

/usr/bin/ls to list files instead of just ls

So that path is an important aspect of unix/bash that you will never really hear
about until it becomes a bug :) 

Let's put nextflow in our path (just as ls, cd etc are) so we can call it from anywhere on fiji.

```{bash $PATH}

echo $PATH
# we can make it easier to read with TRANSFORM (tr) a powerful bash command to
# repalce and find text.

echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"
# kinda hard to read with : seperated file

```


Now let's add nextflow to our .profile 
.profile is loaded each time you login to the terminal
```{BASH .profile}

cd ~/.profile

```

To append a directory to PATH, we just need to overwrite the path variable
To assign a variable in bash the assignment operator is the equals sign. 
When referring to the contents saved in an environment variable, the $ is used
```{bash source .profile}

# if you don't have a path in your .profile we can add

cat .profile 
# should look like this (paste in with nano if no .profile file)
PATH=$PATH:~/bin

# then source the profile so it will be embedded each time your shell starts.

source ~/.profile

# Since /bin is in our path then after we source it will automatically
# load in each session (just like ls, cd etc..)


```


Now check that nextflow can be run without referring to it's location
```{BASH}

nextflow -version
```

Sweet, that's it. We've successfully installed nextflow, added to $APTH and can use from anywhere now!


****************
Step 3: Install nf-core/chipseq pipeline
****************

Now we want to install the chipseq pipeline from NF-core. The cool thing about 
this set up is essentially you are going to clone the latest github for chipseq
by default. Simply run:


```{BASH download chip-seq pipeline}

# this is all you need to download the pipeline
# note nextflow is the language being used to manage this task
nextflow pull nf-core/chipseq

```

If you want a specific version you can use the flag to call that version.
At the time of this document chipseq is at 1.2.1. 

```{BASH specific nf_core pipeline version}

nextflow pull -r 1.2.1 nf-core/chipseq

```

Whenever the pipeline is run, it actually does this step behind the scenes,
so you don't actually need to do this in order to have the chipseq pipeline install.
This means that if you want to run an older version, you can just indicate that when
you're running that pipeline and it will install that version if it's not 
already installed.

*********************
Step 4: Think about your directory structure
*********************

We have set up the class with the following directory structure -- let's make your directory nice and tidy.
We will run our first test ChIP in the work directory.

```{BASH setting up }
cd /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/<your-folder>/class_exeRcises

# first make a directory for all analyses in the class
mdkir analysis

# move to analysis 
cd analysis

# make a new directory associated with the .RMD 
# e.g. 05_flowing_with_nextflow
# in each dir associated with a given .RMD we will make:

mkdir results
mkdir work
mdir figures # if there are no figures this isn't needed.

```


Sometimes nextflow versions don't work so well with a given pipeline. 

1) You may need an edge release installed -- once installed all "self-update" commands will stay on edge

>>> to remove edge rlease: export NXF_EDGE=0

2) To updarte nextflow:

Nextflow self-update
